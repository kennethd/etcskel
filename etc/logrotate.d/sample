# this example logrotate configuration will rotate all *.log files in my
# $HOME/var/log directory (not subdirectories!) daily, keeping 5 days worth of
# old logs around, and compressing the old ones after the first day.  It does
# not raise an error if no file matches the filename spec, and doesn't bother
# rotating empty files.  For more options and examples, see `man 8 logrotate`.

# To enable this for your $HOME directory, uncomment the stanza below & change
# "kenneth" to your own username (chances are if you try to rotate my logs,
# you will just get a lot of permission errors).  You can add as many config
# files to this directory as you want, and they will all run daily.

#/home/kenneth/var/log/*.log { 
#        daily 
#        compress 
#        delaycompress 
#        rotate 5 
#        missingok
#        notifempty
