# this example logrotate configuration will rotate all *.log files in my
# $HOME/var/log directory (and one level of subdirectories) daily, keeping 5
# days worth of old logs around, and compressing the old ones after the first
# day.  It does not raise an error if no file matches the filename spec, and
# doesn't bother rotating empty files.  For more options and examples, see
# `man 8 logrotate`.

# To enable this for your HOME directory, copy this file into another in this
# same logrotate.d directory, uncomment the stanza below, and change
# "/home/kenneth" to your own HOME.  You can add as many config files to this
# directory as you want, and they will all run daily.

#/home/kenneth/var/log/*.log 
#/home/kenneth/var/log/*/*.log
