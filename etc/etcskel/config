#ETCSKEL_VERSION_URL="http://git.ylayali.net/etcskel-version"

# to be overwritten
#ETCSKEL_BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backups/etcskel"

# Set to anything but the NULL string to see info messages about what is being
# written.  A status line for each file will be written to STDERR, and for any
# files not being updated, but for which changes exist, a context diff is 
# written to STDOUT.  This allows you to run the script like: 
#
#   $ etcskel-update >/tmp/my-etcskel-update.diff
#
# to see an overview of what happened, and gives you a diff file to investigate
# further
