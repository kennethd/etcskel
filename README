This file was installed with your user account to describe a few special
features of accounts on this system.  

====== BACKUPS ======

The main feature provided is automatic backups.  My server isn't guaranteed to
not die & when it does I would feel bad if I hadn't done everything I could to
prevent my users from losing important data.  

There are two equally important parts to a successful backup plan: creating the
backup (done, as described below), and copying the backup to a remote host

===== automatic backups =====

The provided automatic backup scripts will not only backup your files, but also
document the server environment: which packages are installed (along with their
versions) for e.g. python, perl, and php libs

The default location for backup storage is ~/backups:

  fusetron@gilgamesh:~$ ls -l ~/backups/
  drwxr-sr-x 2 fusetron fusetron    4096 Sep  2 00:12 conf
  drwxr-sr-x 2 fusetron fusetron    4096 Sep  2 00:32 full

===== rsync-backups ======

If you have an internet-accessable host somewhere you can configure
rsync-backups to take care of transferring your backups for you.

If you do not already have another file server up & running somewhere, it will be
up to you to copy the generated backups to another computer.

====== CRON ======

One of the side benefits of the backup setup is a certain transparency wrt cronjobs

====== UPGRADING ======

You may want to update your setup periodically; a script is provided for you,
but it will overwrite any files managed by this package, so be careful if you
have made local modifications
